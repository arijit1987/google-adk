# Budget-Friendly International Trip Planner Agent

This repository contains a Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) agent designed to help users plan budget-friendly international trips. It leverages a multi-agent system to brainstorm travel ideas and refine them based on a user-provided budget.

## Description

The `PlannerAgent` acts as the main agent, coordinating two specialized sub-agents:

*   **`IdeaGenerator`**: This agent brainstorms travel destinations, activities, and itineraries based on user preferences and requests. It acts as a creative travel agent, generating a wide range of initial ideas.
*   **`RefinerAgent`**: This agent takes the ideas generated by the `IdeaGenerator` and filters them to select only those estimated to be within the user's budget for an international trip. It ensures the final suggestions are budget-conscious.

The `PlannerAgent` orchestrates these sub-agents to provide users with a refined list of international trip ideas that align with their budget.

## Prerequisites

Before running this agent, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

*   **Python 3.9+**: Python must be installed on your system.
*   **Google ADK**: Install the Google Agent Development Kit. You can find installation instructions in the [official Google ADK documentation](https://developers.google.com/agent-development-kit).  Typically, this involves:
    ```bash
    pip install google-adk
    ```
*   **Google API Key**: You need a Google API key to use the Gemini models. You can obtain one from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
*   **`.env` file**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory of this repository to store your API key.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Install Google ADK (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    pip install google-adk
    ```

3.  **Set up the `.env` file:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the repository.
    *   Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing `API-KEYS` with your actual Google API key:

        ```.env
        GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY
        ```

    **Important:** Ensure you replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your valid Google API key.

## Usage

To run the `PlannerAgent`, you will typically interact with it through an ADK runtime environment or a custom application that utilizes the ADK.

**Example Interaction (Conceptual):**

Assuming you have an ADK runtime environment set up, you would interact with the `PlannerAgent` by providing a user request. For example:

```
User Request: "I want to plan a budget-friendly international trip for 7 days. My budget is $1500. I'm interested in exploring historical sites and trying local cuisine."
```

The `PlannerAgent` would then:

1.  **`IdeaGenerator`**: Brainstorm travel ideas based on "historical sites," "local cuisine," and "international trip."
2.  **`RefinerAgent`**: Filter the brainstormed ideas to select only those likely to cost under $1500 for a 7-day international trip.
3.  **Present to User**: Return a refined list of budget-friendly international trip ideas along with the $1500 budget.

**Running with ADK Runtime (General Guidance):**

Refer to the Google ADK documentation for specific instructions on running agents within an ADK runtime environment.  The general steps might involve:

1.  Ensure your ADK runtime is configured correctly and can discover agents (refer to ADK documentation on agent discovery).
2.  Start the ADK runtime environment.
3.  Interact with the `PlannerAgent` through the runtime's interface, providing user requests.

## Code Explanation

### `__init__.py`

```.py
from .agent import agent
```

This file simply imports the `agent` object (which is the `root_agent`) from the `agent.py` file. This makes the `root_agent` discoverable by the ADK runtime as the main agent of this package.

### `agent.py`

```.py
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import google_search

MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash-001"

idea_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="IdeaGenerator",
    description="An agent that generates ideas and suggestions based on user preferences and requests.",
    instruction="You are a creative travel agent. Use the tool to brainstorm ideas and suggestions for travel destinations, activities, and itineraries based on user preferences.",
    model=MODEL,
    #tools=[google_search],
    disallow_transfer_to_parent=True
)

refiner_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="RefinerAgent",
    description="Review provided travel ideas and select only those estimated to cost under the provided budget for a international trip.",
    instruction="Use your tool to review the provided trip ideas. Respond only with the ideas likely to cost under the provided budget for a international trip. Do not provide any additional information.",
    model=MODEL,
    #tools=[google_search],
    disallow_transfer_to_parent=True
)

root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="PlannerAgent",
    model=MODEL,
    instruction=f"""You are trip planner, coordinating specialist agents.
Your goal is to provide budget-friendly international trip ideas. For each user requests follow the below instructions:
    1. First use {idea_agent} to brainstorm ideas based on the user requests.
    2. Then use {refiner_agent} to take those ideas to filter them for the provided budget.
    3. Present the final refined list to the user along with the budget.""",
    sub_agents=[idea_agent, refiner_agent]
)

# Export the root agent for ADK to discover
agent = root_agent
```

*   **Imports:**
    *   `LlmAgent` from `google.adk.agents`:  Used to create Language Model Agents.
    *   `google_search` from `google.adk.tools`:  (Commented out) This line imports the Google Search tool, which could be added to the agents to enhance their capabilities (e.g., for real-time information retrieval).

*   **`MODEL = "gemini-2.0-flash-001"`**: Defines the language model used by all agents. Here, it's set to `gemini-2.0-flash-001`.

*   **`idea_agent`**:
    *   `LlmAgent`: Creates an LLM agent.
    *   `name`: "IdeaGenerator" -  A descriptive name for the agent.
    *   `description`: Explains the agent's purpose.
    *   `instruction`: Sets the agent's persona and task. It's instructed to act as a creative travel agent and brainstorm ideas.
    *   `model`: Specifies the language model (`MODEL`).
    *   `tools`:  Currently commented out, but could include `google_search` to allow the agent to use Google Search for idea generation.
    *   `disallow_transfer_to_parent=True`: Prevents this agent from transferring control back to its parent agent (`root_agent`) prematurely.

*   **`refiner_agent`**:
    *   `LlmAgent`: Creates an LLM agent.
    *   `name`: "RefinerAgent" - A descriptive name for the agent.
    *   `description`: Explains the agent's purpose - refining ideas based on budget.
    *   `instruction`:  Instructs the agent to review provided trip ideas and filter them based on a budget for an international trip. It emphasizes responding only with the refined ideas and no extra information.
    *   `model`: Specifies the language model (`MODEL`).
    *   `tools`:  Currently commented out, but could potentially use tools for budget estimation in the future.
    *   `disallow_transfer_to_parent=True`: Prevents premature control transfer.

*   **`root_agent`**:
    *   `LlmAgent`: Creates the main LLM agent.
    *   `name`: "PlannerAgent" -  The name of the root agent.
    *   `model`: Specifies the language model (`MODEL`).
    *   `instruction`:  This is the core instruction for the `PlannerAgent`. It defines its role as a trip planner coordinating specialist agents. It outlines the workflow:
        1.  Use `idea_agent` for brainstorming.
        2.  Use `refiner_agent` to filter ideas by budget.
        3.  Present the refined list and budget to the user.
    *   `sub_agents=[idea_agent, refiner_agent]`:  Defines the `idea_agent` and `refiner_agent` as sub-agents that the `PlannerAgent` will orchestrate.

*   **`agent = root_agent`**:  This line exports the `root_agent` as `agent`. This is crucial for the ADK runtime to discover and use the `PlannerAgent` as the main agent within this package.

## Environment Variables

*   **`GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=FALSE`**:  This variable specifies that you are using the Google AI Gemini API directly (not through Vertex AI). Set to `FALSE` for direct API access.
*   **`GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY`**: This variable holds your Google API key, which is required to authenticate your requests to the Gemini models. **Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GOOGLE_API_KEY` with your actual API key.**

**Security Note:**  It is crucial to keep your API key secure. Avoid committing your `.env` file with your API key to public repositories. Consider using environment variable management tools for production deployments.
